Each document will store all the data captured by the form. This structure provides simplicity and ease of querying. Security rules should restrict write access to authenticated users or allow unauthenticated writes if appropriate CAPTCHA or other anti-spam measures are in place. List operations will be secure by default, but you will have the option to create custom rules if you like."
