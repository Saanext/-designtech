/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Interior Design Mastery application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes security by default. It focuses on protecting contact form submissions.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The primary data resides in the `/contactFormSubmissions/{contactFormSubmissionId}` collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Unauthenticated writes are explicitly denied for contact form submissions due to the absence of CAPTCHA or anti-spam measures.
 * - Read operations are denied by default, but can be set to public via security rules.
